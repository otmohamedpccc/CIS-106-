* A VPN(Virtual Private Network) is an encrypted connection created over the internet from a device to a network. Encrypted connections ensure private or sensitive data is hidden from prying eyes. a vpn can prevent eavesdropping and can allow a user to work remotely. VPNs are used by the average consumer and is also common in a corporate environment. (cisco)

* a vpn works by routing your devices internet connection through the chosen/created vpn server rather than the standard ISP so when data is transmitted over the internet, it will come from the vpn instead of the computer. This means if you peruse the web on a vpn the data will only come from the vpn. (cisco)

* You should use a vpn because it can ensure privacy when websurfing  and safety when dealing with sensitive information. When connecting to the internet, your ISP is the one to make the connection. When connction is established you are instantly given adn tracked by an IP address (kaspersky) Your isp can seem trustworthy but they may share your browsing history with advertisers, the police/govt and/or by third parties. 

* ISP - Internet Service Provider (ex.optimum,verizon) provides internet as a service which a person has to pay for

* ISPs can fall victim to attacks which can lead to personal information being leaked.

* an ip address is a unique address that identifies a device and its location on the internet or local area network. Ip means internet protocal, which is a set of rules that govern the format of data sent via the internet or local network (kaspersky)

* A  good vpn should : hide your ip, prevent leaving traces in the form of internet history and cookies. Encryption of of cookies is impartant because it prevents 3rd party access to important information such as financial information and personal data. it should have a kill switch in the event connection is suddenly interrupted.

* a vpns encryption can only be decoded using a key which only the users computer and the vpn know meaning your isp and third parties cannot recognize where what youre doing.

## Types of vpns 
* SSL VPN - is a vpn that enables individual users access to an organizations network, client server applications, and internal network utilites and directories without the need for special software -(fortinet.com) a prerequisite needed is a browser that is capable usually requiring HTML-5. virtually every internet browser is capable of establishing a connection. when connection is established, username and password login is required.
  * HTML 5 is a markup language used for structuring and presenting content on the web. Almost every web browser is html 5.

* Site to Site - is essentially a private network designed to hide privte intranets and allow users of these secure networks to access each others resources. site to site is useful for companies with multiple locations each with its own LAN connected to WAN. Mainly used in large companies. Complex to implement and do not offer as much flexibility as SSL but they are the most effective way to ensure communication in and between company departments

* Client to Server- an connection established not through your isp but through a vpn sever/provider. Instead of using VPN to create an encryption tunnel to disguise the existing connection, the vpn cna automatically encrypt the data before its made to available to the user. A vpn client must be first installed and configured on the computer. This is the most common form of vpn used and is particularly useful for providers of insecure WLAN because it prevents third parties from accessing the connection as it encrypts data all the way to the provider. it will also prevent ISPs from accessing data that remains unencrypted and bypasses  any internet access restrictions set in place.

intranet- local or restricted communications network, especially private created using world wide web software.

## How to install 
* VPN clients - software must be installed 
* Browser extensions - Extensions make it easier for users to quickly switch and configure their VPN while surfing the internet. However, the VPN connection is only valid for information that is shared in this browser. Using other browsers and other internet uses outside the browser cannot be encrypted by the VPN.
* Router VPN - if multiple devices are connected it may be easier to implement a vpn on your router than installing a separate vpn for each device
