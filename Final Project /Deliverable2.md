* Minecraft.net

* What is SpigotMC.org? - SpigotMC.org is home to the community behind the biggest Minecraft server software projects and provides a place for everyone involved with minecraft servers to connect with each other whether theyre seeking help and support or sharing and showcasing their work. SpigotMC.org provides a webforum, chatroom, and wiki for providing support aswell as project hosting for content creators. Spigot hopes to have new users join the growing community of 300,000 members

* What is Spigot?- is a modified Minecraft server based on CraftBukkit which provides additional performance optimizations, configuration options and features, whilst still remaining compatible with all existing plugins and consistent with Vanilla Minecraft game mechanics.There are over 150 improvements present in only in Spigot, including BungeeCord support; configuration of many internal server values such as crop growth rates, hunger, entity tracking, map seeds; enhanced watchdog and timings profiling to catch plugin issues; further configuration to heavy elements such as entity activation and hoppers; rewritten chunk loading, unloading and saving; and some useful API additions for developers.

* CraftBukkit- a modified version of the Vanilla Minecraft Server which allows it to run Bukkit plugins. The main goal of this project is to produce a server as close to Vanilla as possible, barring the addition of plugin support. That being said CraftBukkit still retains some useful configurability and optimizations such as asynchronous chunk loading, and also fixes for some critical Vanilla bugs or exploits.

* Bukkit - Bukkit is the API that developers can use to make server plugins

* API - Application Plugin Interface which allows applications to talk to each other

* BuildTools.jar - is the solution to building Bukkit, CratBukkit, Spigot, Spigot-API

## What is Minecraft
* What is Minecraft - Minecraft is a single/multiplayer sandbox that challenges players to survive, build, and, defeat mobs(enemies) using the natural resources around the minecraft world. Each time a new world is created, a new seed is generated, meaning every Minecraft world is totally unique.
