# Deliverable 1

1. I will be creating a vpn server
   
2. I have chosen this project because I never had a full understanding of servers, let alone vpn servers. So im doing this project to gain some knowledge on vpn.
    
3. Possible problems or roadblocks I anticipate are connection and ip config issues.
   
4. I plan on learning what can fix these difficulties and Id also like to learn what common issues there are involving vpn servers.
   
5. I think it will give me some slight understanding in the network administration career because it has to do with ip addresses and monitoring and maintaining networks.
