1. I will be completing building a Minecraft server
   
2. I have chosen this project because I am interested in Minecraft and learning about servers for my major which is Network Administration 

3. I can anticipate mainly server connection errors.

4. I plan on searching for advice or the specific help I need through the power of the internet 

5. I think completing this project will give me some insight to how servers work and are operated which in turn will provide a small foundation on servers for network administration careers as that career mainly handles operation and mediation of servers and its information.
