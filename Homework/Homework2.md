# Part 1
1. Open source software is generally safe, the user can modify its code, and it is generally more reliable.

2. The 4 freedoms that make sofware open source.
* **Freedom 0**- the user can run the program as you wish, for any purpose
* **Freedom 1**- the user can study how the program works, and change it
* **Freedom 2**- the user can redistribute the copies
* **Freeedom 3**- the user can distribute copies of your modified versions 

3. People should use an open source alternative because it financially is low cost, there is a plethora of non corporate support, and most open source has low requirements for hardware. 
   
4. I agree with Richard Stallman on why free software is important. The 4 freedoms are the main reason as to why open source is so important and valuable and besides those freedoms, there is no user-software subjugation, meaning there is no one controlling or limiting your moves in doing what they wish with certain software. And with users having collective control of a software rather than one sole owner or company, it means the group can work together and re distribute improved copies of open source software rather than having to pay for assistance or new updates.
